# scRNA-seq_PLT1_WOX5

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis pipeline and supporting files for our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) study exploring early transcriptional reprogramming in *Arabidopsis thaliana* root cells following the ectopic induction of two key transcription factors: PLT1 and WOX5. The study aims to dissect the cellular dynamics and gene regulatory mechanisms involved in cell fate transitions during early root regeneration.

## Objectives

- Identify major cell types and developmental zones in the *Arabidopsis* root using scRNA-seq.
- Characterize how PLT1-WOX5 induction alters cell identity over a 10-hour time course.
- Analyze the dynamics of dedifferentiation and pluripotency-related gene expression.
- Model protein structures and predict potential physical interactions between PLT1 and WOX5.
- Investigate shared downstream transcriptional targets and their functional roles in reprogramming.

## Key Findings

- **Cell Identity Changes**: PLT1-WOX5 induction triggers rapid and specific changes in root cell identities. Notably, there is an expansion of lateral root cap (LRC) and atrichoblast cell populations, alongside a marked reduction in xylem and phloem pole pericycle (XPP and PPP) cells.
- **Dedifferentiation Pathways**: A subset of XPP cells shows activation of pluripotency markers and Cajal body formation, indicating a transient dedifferentiation trajectory.
- **Gene Regulatory Networks**: Transcriptional targets of PLT1 and WOX5 are enriched for genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, suggesting coordinated regulation of cellular reprogramming machinery.
- **Structural Modeling**: AlphaFold and docking simulations suggest potential physical interactions between PLT1 and the disordered C-terminal region of WOX5, supporting a cooperative model of action.
