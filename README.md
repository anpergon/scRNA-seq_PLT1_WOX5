# scRNA-seq_PLT1_WOX5

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis pipeline and supporting files for our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) study exploring early transcriptional reprogramming in *Arabidopsis thaliana* root cells following the overexpression of two key transcription factors: PLT1 and WOX5. The study aims to dissect the cellular dynamics and gene regulatory mechanisms involved in cell fate transitions during early root regeneration.

## Objectives

- Explain the cellular trajectories from root tissue to callus after *PLT1*-*WOX5* overexpression during a 10-hour window (and the underlying transcriptional programs).
- Study the interaction between PLT1 and WOX5 to explain the main features involved in it and discuss the possible biological implications.

## Key Findings

- **Cell Identity Changes**: *PLT1*-*WOX5* overexpression triggers rapid and specific changes in root cell identities indicated by the KL divergence-weighted cosine distance calculation.
- **Gene Regulatory Networks**: A subset of cells that putatively originate from XPP cells shows activation of Cajal body-related genes and ribosome biogenesis, indicating a trend towards dedifferentiation.
- **Structural Modeling**: AlphaFold-metainference accurately generates a structural ensemble for WOX5.
